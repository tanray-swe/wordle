Wordle

This is my very own attempt from scratch at a simple Wordle implementation using Python 3.

Rules:
* All guesses must be five letter words found in the file five_letter_words.txt
* You have a maximum of six guesses.

There are two versions:
* wordle_func.py: Written using traditional "methods". Non-OOP approach. This was my initial successful attempt.
* wordle_oop.py:  Re-written using an "OOP" approach.

Here is the key to decode the hint given after each guess:
* O: Letter is in the right place.
* o: Letter is in the wrong place.
* .: Letter is not found.

Have fun!
